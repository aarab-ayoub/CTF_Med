"We intercepted an audio file suspected to contain a hidden message. Our analysts say the flag is encoded in its frequency spectrum, but we can't decode it. Can you uncover the secret?"

Hints (Tiered Difficulty)
Hint 1 (Easy)

"The audio is split into equal time segments. Each segment hides one character."
Hint 2 (Medium)

"A base frequency of 1000 Hz is used. Characters are encoded as frequency offsets."
Hint 3 (Hard)

"Use FFT on each segment. Subtract 1000 Hz and divide by 10 to decode ASCII."
