    "Our server was hacked, and the attacker left a corrupted memory dump. We managed to extract this suspicious file, but it’s not what it seems. The flag is hidden, but you’ll need to dig deep to find it."
Hints (If Stuck)

    Hint 1: "Not all memory is what it seems. Look beyond the headers."

    Hint 2: "Common XOR keys are 0xAA, 0x55, or 0xFF."

    Hint 3: "The flag is 30 bytes long, starting at offset 0x10000."
